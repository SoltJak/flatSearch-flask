# Flat Search Aggregator

This project is aimed at designing a search engine for real estate market in Warsaw, Poland.

It aggregates searches (for user specified parameters) from various search pages, removing the necessity to visit all of them, in order to get all of the offers. 

Therefore, its main goal is to reduce users' (someone who looks for a flat) time that they need to spend to check if any new offers appeared from the last time they searched.
